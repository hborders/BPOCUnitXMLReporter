BPOCUnitXMLReporter
===================

BPOCUnitXMLReporter is a small piece of utility code that can be built into an
OCUnit test bundle.  When the tests are run, BPOCUnitXMLReporter will create
an XML test output file in the style of the Ant Java XML plugin.  This allows
OCUnit test results to be processed by various automated build and testing
tools, such as [Hudson][].
